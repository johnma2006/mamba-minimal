## mamba-minimal

Simple, minimal implementation of Mamba in one file of PyTorch.

Featuring:
* Equivalent numerical output as official implementation for both forward and backward pass
* Simplified, readable, annotated code

Does NOT include:
* Speed. The official implementation is heavily optimized, and these optimizations are core contributions of the Mamba paper. I kept most implementations simple for readability.
* Proper parameter initialization (though this could be added without sacrificing readability)

## Demo

See [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) for examples of prompt completions.

```python
from model import Mamba
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model = Mamba.from_pretrained('state-spaces/mamba-370m')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b')

generate(model, tokenizer, 'Mamba is the')
```
> Mamba is the world's longest venomous snake with an estimated length of over 150 m. With such a large size and a venomous bite, Mamba kills by stabbing the victim (which is more painful and less effective than a single stab of the bite)

150 meters... 🫢 scary!

### Demo Setup
You can run the following to install all the packages required:
```
conda create -n mamba-minimal
conda activate mamba-minimal
conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
conda install ipykernel
pip install transformers einops
```
